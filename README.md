#  Assignment 1: Iris Flower Classification using SVM

This repository contains the Python code for an academic assignment focused on machine learning classification. The project implements a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm to classify species of Iris flowers based on their physical measurements.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

- **Dataset:** The classic Iris Flower Dataset, which contains 150 samples from three species of Iris (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*).  
- **Algorithm:** A Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel is used to find the optimal boundary separating the flower species.  
- **Objective:** To train a model that can accurately predict the species of an Iris flower given its **sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width**.  

**Language & Libraries Used:**
- Python 3  
- Scikit-learn  
- Seaborn  
- Matplotlib
